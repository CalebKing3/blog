<h2 id="heading2">Why is so hard to start a blog?</h2>

<p>Look, I am going to be blunt, starting a blog is simple. Getting the site setup, buying a domain name, actually writing post is easy. The hard part is execution. I'm noticing execution is what is seperating people who do great work and those who talk about great ideas. I'm not a motivational speaker but I wanted to start a blog to go over coding things, speak my mind, and put in a funny gif here and there. Why is starting a blog so hard? Let's dive into it.

<h3 id="heading3">Where to start?</h3>
<p>
These days, we have so many options to start publishing content. Somtimes having too many options can be a bad thing. Do you start on Youtube, do you write on Medium, do you just tweet a lot hoping Ronnie Moas retweets your post about cryptocurrency and hoping you become a crypto-expert. OK, that last one hasn't happened yet but I can still be hopeful.

To anwser the question, "Where to start" start by taking action. If you found this site, I am assuming you are somewhat techincal. If you want to start a blog, find a jekyll theme you enjoy and fork the project. Then give yourself a round of appaulaus you are already halfway there.

<h3 id="heading3">What took me so long? The setup</h3>
<p>I am not going to lie, I just did not take action. I kept telling myself I am going to write a post, but never actually wrote a post. I would start my day listening to motivational videos hoping something would go off in my head to say "Today is the day I am going to write my post". Still nothing happened. I know, you are probably thinking to yourself, you sound like a lazy person. I can be, but its mostly due to time management. What helped me get started blogging was putting it in my calendar app on my phone and dedicating 30 minutes to write a post. That was it. Just deciding to actually do the thing you want to do. Simple.

<p>Remeber the benefit of the blog is to get your thoughts and opinons out there because its 2018 and employers are no longer impressed
with your perfectly formatted resume. They want to see your projects, how you think, what technologies interest you. You can also use your blog to simply
share some solutions you have found with some problems stackoverflow or google can't seem to anwser. Need help getting a blog started, check out my post. "Setting up your blog". Good luck!
