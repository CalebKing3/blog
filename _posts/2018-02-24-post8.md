<h2 id="heading2">Why is so hard to start a blog?</h2>

<p>
Look, I am going to be blunt, starting a blog is simple. Getting the site setup, buying a domain, actually writing a post is easy. The hard part is execution. I'm noticing implementation is what is separating people who do great work from those who talk about doing great work. I'm not a motivational speaker, but I wanted to start a blog to go over technology topics, voice my opinon, and put in a funny gif here and there to make you smile. Why is starting a blog so hard? Let's dive into it.

<h3 id="heading3">Where to start?</h3>
<p>
These days, we have so many options to start publishing content. Sometimes having too many options can be a bad thing. Do you start on Youtube, do you write on Medium, do you just tweet a lot hoping Ronnie Moas retweets your post about cryptocurrency and hoping you become a crypto-expert. OK, that last one hasn't happened yet, but I am still hopeful.

To answer the question, "Where to start" start by taking action. If you found this site, I am assuming you are somewhat technical. If you want to start a blog, Google, "how to start a blog". Then give yourself a round of applause you are already halfway there. If you are developer, I would recommend looking into static site genertators like Jekyll or Gatsby, if you are less techy then there is Wordpress, Blogger, Squarespace and so many more platforms. JUST START NOW!

I am not going to lie; I just did not take action. Actually one of my weaknesses is execution. I even had a deep talking with my girlfriend who even said, "yeah it seem execution is hard for you". Man that was so true. I kept telling myself I am going to write a post, but never actually wrote a post. I would start my day listening to motivational videos hoping something would go off in my head to say "Today is the day I am going to write my post." Still, nothing happened. I know, you are probably thinking to yourself, you sound like a lazy person. I can be, but it is mostly due to time management. What helped me get started blogging was putting it in my calendar app on my phone and dedicating 30 minutes to write a post. That was it. Just deciding to do the thing you want to do. Simple.

Remeber the benefit of the blog is to get your thoughts and opinions out there because its 2018 and employers are no longer impressed with your perfectly formatted resume. They want to see your projects, how you think, what technologies interest you. You can also use your blog to simply share some solutions you have found with some problems StackOverflow or Google can't seem to directly answer. Need help getting a blog started, check out my post. "Setting up your blog." Good luck!
