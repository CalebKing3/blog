<h2 id="heading2">Who am I?</h2>

<p>
I am Batman! Well that is what I tell myself when I am daydreaming. My name is Caleb. I am software developer. I'm orignally from the 805, (SoCal) but now reside in Phoenix, AZ. I like to consider Phoenix the next tech capital in the making. Most people think Arizona is just a really hot place,but that's only during 3 months of the year. The other parts we have some of the best weather compared to most of the world. I had to get that one off my chest. For this post I wanted to give my followers more inside on the guy who host the "People In Tech" podcast. Oh, you didn't know, I am host of the #1 technology podcast on Anchor [People In Tech](anchor.fm/people-in-tech). My Podcast is focused on talking about Tech + News + Hip-Hop/Culture. I interview top tech talent within the industry and cover common topics

I've been in the software development industry for a few years now, but decided it's time to start helping people who were in my situation a few years ago. By no means am I an expert, but I'm here to help. This blog will cover common tech topics most developers experience. This is my second post, but for my next post I want give insturctions on how I made my portfolio/blog for FREE. I come from a e-learning background and my grandma mama were educators, so giving back to the community is very important to me. I know sometimes searching Google for anwsers isn't ideal because it requires some additional hunting. I want to do my best to put content out there for my followers. I have my podcast, this blog, and soon a vlog. I'm sure some of you are asking, what do I get out of this. Well, getting my name out there has some inner rewards, knowing I could help solve someone else problem that I've already encounter and to promote my brand as a technologist.

Like I said earlier I have a few projects I'm currently working on. Here is a list of all the things I've worked on, including failures, successes and overall interest. 
 
 * [Veganeats.io](https:veganeats.io)
 * [People In Tech](anchor.fm/people-in-tech)
 * [Podcast Sound](add linkt)
 * [G-Code, urban e-learning](add link)

 Those are the projects, and some of the links might not work because I either took down the site or working on bringing it back to life. OMG it's alive. Except in this case it's not. Anyways, I wanted to share some of my projects becasuse I am learing from my failures. I want this blog to be a success not just for my followers but also for myself. I think the best way to learn is by doing. I believe being able to teach certain topics not only helps the student but also ensures the teacher knows what they are talking about. Anyways, I gotta work on this post but this is what I got for now. It's hard writing after a few glasses of wine lol.

Remeber the benefit of the blog is to get your thoughts and opinions out there because its 2018 and employers are no longer impressed with your perfectly formatted resume. They want to see your projects, how you think, what technologies interest you. You can also use your blog to simply share some solutions you have found with some problems StackOverflow or Google can't seem to directly answer. Need help getting a blog started, check out my post. "Setting up your blog." Good luck!
